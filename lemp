Installing the Nginx web server
Since this is our first time using apt for this session, we update the server's package index
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nginx
To verify if it is installed and running we use 
sudo systemctl status nginx
If it is green, it is working fine, but I came across a problem, which was, I had apache2 running on my tcp port 80 so nginx could not run.
I had to stop apache2 using 
systemctl stop apache2
Then i restarted nginx again 
sudo systemctl restart nginx
 
 After that we have to install mysql, mysql has been installed, so I don't need to install it again.
 I went straight to 
 
 Installing php
 Here, I have 2 things to install, php-mysql and php-fpm. php-mysql is the PHP module that allows PHP to communicate with MySQL-based databases. 
 Core PHP packages will automatically be installed as dependencies while php-fpm stands for “PHP fastCGI process manager”, and tell Nginx to pass 
 PHP requests to this software for processing.
 To isntall the 2 packages at once run:
 sudo  apt install php-fpm php-mysql
 Next you have to configure nginxto use them    
 
 CONFIGURING NGINX TO USE PHP PROCESSOR
 I created a new directory using
sudo mkdir /var/www/projectlemp
Then I assigned ownership of the directory with the $USER environment variable, which will reference your current system user:
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /var/www/projectlemp
Then, open a new configuration file in Nginx’s sites-available directory.
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/projectlemp
inside the text editor
paste
#/etc/nginx/sites-available/projectLEMP

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name projectLEMP www.projectLEMP;
    root /var/www/projectLEMP;

    index index.html index.htm index.php;
location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
    }

    location ~ \.php$ {
        include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
        fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php7.4-fpm.sock;
     }

    location ~ /\.ht {
        deny all;
    }

}
The text editor i used here is nano, to save in nano you use control X and then y and enter.
Then I activated my configuration by linking to the config file from Nginx’s sites-enabled directory
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/projectLEMP /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
 Then I tested the configuration for syntax errors
 sudo nginx -t
 
I also disabled default Nginx host that is currently configured to listen on port 80.
sudo unlink /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
Then I reloaded my nginx
sudo systemctl reload nginx

My website is now active, but it is empty, so I created an index.html file
sudo echo 'Hello lemp one from hostname' $(curl -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/public-hostname) 
'with public IP' $(curl -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/public-ipv4) > /var/www/projectlemp/index.html
This displayed Hello lemp one, my dns name

THE I TESTED PHP WITH NGINX
I opened a file called info.php
sudo nano /var/www/projectlemp/info.php
Inside the text editor 
<?php
phpinfo();
Then I opened it on my browser, it showed me details about my server.
But I had to remove it because it contained sensitive information
sudo rm /var/www/your_domain/info.php

RETRIEVING DATA FROM MYSQL DATABASE WITH PHP
I connected to mysql
sudo mysql
Then I created a database
CREATE DATABASE `lemp_database`;
I created a user with password
CREATE USER 'lemp_user'@'%' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'password';
Then I gave the user permission
GRANT ALL ON example_database.* TO 'example_user'@'%';
and I exited mysql
exit
I tested if the user I created has the proper permissions
mysql -u example_user -p'
I was asked for the user password
Then I checked if i had access to the database
SHOW DATABASES;
Then I created a table
CREATE TABLE example_database.todo_list (
     item_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT,
   content VARCHAR(255),
    PRIMARY KEY(item_id)
);
Then I added content into it
INSERT INTO example_database.todo_list (content) VALUES ("My first important item");
I needed to see the output
SELECT * FROM example_database.todo_list;
mysql exit

I had to create a php script that will connect to mysql
nano /var/www/projectLEMP/todo_list.php
Once the text editor was open 
<?php
$user = "example_user";
$password = "password";
$database = "example_database";
$table = "todo_list";

try {
  $db = new PDO("mysql:host=localhost;dbname=$database", $user, $password);
  echo "<h2>TODO</h2><ol>";
  foreach($db->query("SELECT content FROM $table") as $row) {
    echo "<li>" . $row['content'] . "</li>";
  }
  echo "</ol>";
} catch (PDOException $e) {
    print "Error!: " . $e->getMessage() . "<br/>";
    die();
}

then I saved the file using control x then Y and enter
and I opened my file in my browser.
